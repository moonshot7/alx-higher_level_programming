# 0x07  Python - Test-driven development :snake:

> Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It's often used as a “scripting language” for web applications. This means that it can automate specific series of tasks, making it more efficient. This project covers classes and objects! (The beginning for OOP an awesome programming paradigm)

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:
  
* What’s an interactive test
* Why tests are important
* How to write Docstrings to create tests
* How to write documentation for each module and function
* What are the basic option flags to create tests
* How to find edge cases

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Function that adds 2 integers.
1. Function that divides all elements of a matrix.
2. Function that prints My name is <first name> <last name>
3. Function that prints a square with the character #.
4. Function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters: ., ? and :
5. Unittests for the function def max_integer(list=[]):.
6. Function that multiplies 2 matrices:
7. Function that multiplies 2 matrices by using the module NumPy
8. Function that prints Python strings.
